# ScamBott

A simple, open-source, free discord Scamming Bot made by Joee.  
In order to use this, you must know the basics of python, pip, and how to make a discord bot. This bot is written in python, and depends on several libraries: 

{discord.py, json, datetime, random} 


### Changelog:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-

###### [+] Created basic `send_scam` command.
- Sends a "discord" warning message to custom user.
- Links are masked and can be customised in `config.json`.
- Sending check/errors sent to bot owner.

###### [+] Implemented `commands.is_owner()`.
- This only allows the bot owner to use the nuke and stop command. This means that even if someone else runs the command, the bot will not respond. By bot owner, I do not mean myself, but the person who created the Bot Application at the [Discord Developer Portal- Applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

### Future Plans:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

- I do not currently have any future plans for this project and will not maintain it. However, I may come back at any time.
